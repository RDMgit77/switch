# SWITCH for REAM

Welcome! This repository contains the SWITCH electricity planning model adapted for the
REAM research lab.

For **an overview** of what SWITCH is and how it works, read [`docs/Overview.md`](./docs/Overiew.md).

To discover **how to install, run or debug** the different components of Switch, read [`docs/Usage.md`](./docs/Usage.md)

To **see examples** of smaller SWITCH models, see the `examples/` folder.

To discover **how to contribute to the model**, read [`docs/Contribute.md`](/docs/Contribute.md)

To **learn about our database** (e.g. how to connect to it and modify it), read [`docs/Database.md`](/docs/Database.md).

To **generate documentation**, run `pydoc -w switch_model` after having installed
SWITCH. This will build HTML documentation files from python doc strings which
will include descriptions of each module, their intentions, model
components they define, and what input files they expect.

To learn about **numerical solvers** read [`docs/Numerical Solvers.md`](/docs/Numerical%20Solvers.md)

To learn about **numerical issues** read [`docs/Numerical Issues.md`](/docs/Numerical%20Issues.md)
