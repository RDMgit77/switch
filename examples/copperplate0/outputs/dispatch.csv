>>>>>>> 50d052e... Export summaries of dispatch as tables and a figure using pandas and ggplot. Renamed the "wide" dispatch output file to dispatch-wide.txt, not to be confused with the normalized data in dispatch.csv. Also renamed/reformatted other dispatch files from 'txt' to 'csv' to have appropriate associations on most computers.
