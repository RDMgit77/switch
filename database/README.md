# Database folder

This folder tracks changes done to the database. Whenever you make a new
change to the database, create a new script based on `TEMPLATE.sql`.
Name it using the convention `YYYY_MM_DD-<title>.sql`. Then fill out the template
and include your SQL commands. 

For more details read [`docs/Database.md`](/docs/Database.md).
