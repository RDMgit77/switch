1,"For monthly data prior to January 2008, please see table 25-10-0001-01 (terminated). For current monthly data on Electric power receipts and deliveries, see table 25-10-0016-01."
2,"The target population for the Monthly Electricity Supply and Disposition Survey has been expanded to improve coverage of renewable energy in Canada, particularly wind and solar power. As a result of this change, users will have to use caution when comparing data for historical purposes. For wind power, significant changes occurred in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Prince Edward Island. For solar power, significant changes occurred in Ontario."
3,"Electric power generated from a plant in which the turbine generators are driven by flowing water. Prior to January 2008, hydro included wind and tidal generation. From January 2008 on, wind and tidal generation are reported separately."
