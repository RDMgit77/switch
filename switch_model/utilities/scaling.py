"""
Provides the classes and functions needed to support
variable scaling in Pyomo.

Variable scaling is a technique used to resolve
numerical issues that occur when variable coefficients
are too large or too small in magnitude.
To understand variable scaling make sure to read in full the
section "Scaling our model to resolve numerical issues"
in doc/Numerical Solvers.md.

Once you've read that section, you should understand
the purpose of scaling and the high level concept
of how we scale a variable. The following explains in detail
how we've implement variable scaling in SWITCH.

Our goal is to provide a class (ScaledVariable)
that behaves identically to Pyomo's Var class,
but accepts a parameter scaling_factor that specifies
how much the variable (and its coefficients) should
be scaled before being solved. Here's the architecture
used to achieve this goal.

1. We create the class ScaledVariable but ScaledVariable is
really just a "redirect". If scaling is disabled (via _ENABLE_SCALING)
or if the scaling factor is 1 (no scaling) then ScaledVariable
will just redirect us to Pyomo's Var. Otherwise, ScaledVariable
redirects us to _ScaledVariable. To redirect between these two
cases we override the __new__ function.

2. _ScaledVariable is a child class of Pyomo's Var. This means
it behaves the same as Pyomo's Var except for a few key differences.
a) Upon creation the variable bounds are scaled according to the scaling_factor
b) Upon creation we define a few extra properties that are used later.

Up to know we really haven't done much. Creating a ScaledVar instead of a Var
simply creates a _ScaledVar instance (if scaling is enabled) that behaves
in almost all the same ways as Var (except bounds are scaled). Here's where things change.

3. We've overridden the __setattr__ property of Pyomo's AbstractModel to allow for special
behaviours when we assign a _ScaledVariable to the model (see _AbstractModel in switch_model.utilities.__init__.py).
For example, let's consider the following call.

model.MyVariable = ScaledVariable(...)

First we note that ScaledVariable will actually become an instance of _ScaledVariable.
Our modified __setattr__ method will detect this and behave as follows.

a) _ScaledVariable will be added to the model but with the key _scaled_MyVariable rather than MyVariable
b) We will create an expression that depends on _ScaledVariable using get_unscaled_expression()
c) This expression will be assigned to the model where the _ScaledVariable should've been assigned, i.e.
    with the key MyVariable.

4. What's the result of this? Whenever we reference model.MyVariable elsewhere in our code
we will actually be accessing the expression that depends on our _ScaledVariable! Since we're always
referencing the unscaled expression we don't need to worry about the effects of scaling, while at
the same time, Pyomo is using the scaled variable when solving.
